# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor


I spent the majority of the time trying to figure out what exactly I was doing, but once I did it became pretty easy. I ended up changing the semantic tags in the HTML file from <div> and <span> tags to actual fundimental semantic tags that anybody could use to easily read the code put forth. I then edited the alt tags within the image descriptions and edited the title name, making sure to include all necessary information. 

Thank you, and let me know what else I need to do for my projects to be even more efficent.
